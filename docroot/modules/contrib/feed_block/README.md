INTRODUCTION
------------

The Feed Block module displays listings from RSS feeds, each stored in Drupal as blocks, each with display configuration (i.e., number of items, whether to display date & descriptive text, etc.) The module minimally themes these blocks via a tpl.php file. For custom theming, this template can be copied into a sites active theme and modified.
