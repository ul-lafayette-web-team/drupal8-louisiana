INTRODUCTION
------------

Media Responsive Thumbnail combines the Media module with the Responsive Image
module by adding a new field formatter which takes advantage of both functions.

Basically, it lets you display a Media Entity Reference field just like an
Image field with a Responsive Image formatter.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following Core modules:

 * Media
 * Responsive Image

INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Navigate to your Media reference field (or create a new one if needed).
 * Under "Manage display", select "Responsive thumbnail" as the formatter.
 * In the formatter settings (cogwheel icon on the right)
   select the desired Responsive Image style to display the image.
